                                             =======================
This is a simple java application for managing products in a store. Basically it provides save, get, update and remove functionalities (CRUD) related to adding, retriving, updating and removing of products from/to stores located in different locations. I started doing this application to gain knowledge on below technologies. This is just a start. I am going to add more advanced features and functionalities moving forward.

1. Java RESTful web services/Java Jersey Framework 1.7 /JSON
2. Hibernate 3
3. Srping 3
4. Git/GitHub versioning
5. Log4J
6. JUnit unit testing - test driven development (TDD)

How to use the application
==========================
- Download the ProductManagementSystem https://github.com/kanuwana/ProductManagementSystem and ProductManagementSystem-Client https://github.com/kanuwana/ProductManagementSystem-Client applications.
- Add them to your favirite IDE (I use eclipse)
- Set class paths, and resolve any dependancy to library files/jar files. (All the jar files required are bundled into /libs directory No need to download any other jar files. You can just set them into your java build path.
- Install a application server or Tomcat in your IDE. I use WebLogic 12c and Tomcat 7 for ProductManagementSystem and ProductManagementSystem-Client respectively for better hands on experience.
- Run the ProductManagementSystem project and keep it.
- Run the ProductManagementSystem-Client and jsut use it.
- I have gained and covered below development knowledge/handson experience through this.

Java RESTful web services
=========================
- Specific/Strict use of GET,POST,PUT and DELETE
- RESTful - Jersey Annotations

Hibernate 3
===========
- Basic and advanced annotations (Java persistance annotations and hibernate annotations) {Entity, Table, Column, Id, GeneratedValue, Transient, Embedded, Embeddable, GenericGenerator, ElementCollection, CollectionId, OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany, ManyToOne, AttributeOverrides, AttributeOverride, etc}
- Hibernate configurations (caching, hbm2ddl and more configurations in hibernate.cfg.xml hibernate config file)
- Mapping and relationships between entities
- Persisting collecitons, Embedding objects, Casacading objects
- Primary Key, SurrogateKey, Foriegn key relationships
- Attribute overriding
- Proxy object - lazy/Eager initialization
- Persistent, Transient, Detached objects and state changes
- Named queries,HQL
- Paramete binding, SQL injection, Caching 10.Pagination and many more

Spring 3
========
- Dependancy Injection
- AOP for Logging Aspect

Git&GitHub
==========
- Experience on Git Bash, Git GUI and GitHub (online) from the begining

JUnit 4
=======
- Test Driven Development
- Test Runner, Test Suite, Test Case, Test

Logging
=======
- Logging using Log4J
